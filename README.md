# Fault-tolerant and reliable Kafka message consumption with Spring Boot
The purpose of this application is to give a showcase on how
a reliable and fault-tolerant Kafka messaging system can be
implemented using Spring Boot.

The article that covers the implementation can be found
here: https://arnoldgalovics.com/fault-tolerant-and-reliable-messaging-with-kafka-and-spring-boot/

The applicatio uses manual offset commit in order to achieve
at least once message delivery guarantee. Additionally, to
make it more robust, there is a dead-letter queue (DLQ) implemented
as well that is used for two reasons:
- A way of retrying to process messages
- When the retry threshold is reached, it logs the message

## Project structure
### Infrastructure
There's Kafka and Zookeeper needed for the messaging system to
work. In the root directory, there's a `docker-compose.yml`
file available that can be used to set up these components.
It was tested with Docker for Windows, might need some 
tuning for Mac or Linux, specifically on the networking.

### normal-topic-consumer
This is the service that consumes messages from the
`normal-topic` Kafka topic. In case there's an error,
it sends the messages to the `dlq-topic` for applying
the DLQ logic.

### dlq-topic-consumer
This service acts as a DLQ and implements the message
retry. It consumes messages from the `dlq-topic`. It 
resends failed messages to the original topic until
the retry threshold is exceeded.

## Running the system
First, set up the infrastructure:
```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Then start up the 2 microservices (ordering is not important):
```bash
$ ./gradlew clean build bootRun
```

Now, send some messages to the `normal-topic`. You can
exec into the Kafka container and use the kafka-console-producer.sh
to generate the messages.

```bash
$ sh /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic normal-topic
>{"data":"test"}
```
